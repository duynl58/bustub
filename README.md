## Note

I'm no longer trying to finish this educational database management system because I'm pursuing higher education in DBMS.

Therefore, I probably won't work on the last assignment.

Furthermore, my implementation probably contains many bugs, as I did not test it carefully.

However, for students who haven't figured how to start/make progress on the **CMU 15-445/645** assignments, this can be a good hint for you.

Many thanks for your understanding!
